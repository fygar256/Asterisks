# Asterisks
A retro game ran on Commodore CBM-3032 and PET about 40 years ago
issued from 'cursor' software coterie.
This is a rewrite of that. I forgot the name of game, so named it 'Asterisks'

You are a player. Lock up all the enemies with the blocks.
Control keys are tenkey as the direction key. And on main keyboard, 'jkluio789' correspond to
the directions.

To run, chmod +x ast.py and do ./ast.py
requires python3 and some modules.
This is wrote for terminal on linux.
